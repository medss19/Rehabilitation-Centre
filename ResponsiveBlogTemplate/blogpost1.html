Felt empty from within before I chose India, I came to Sanctum as a broken man, just wanted a break from life and today, exactly 170 days after I left, I feel like this was my life’s calling all along. I reconciled with my ex-wife, been clean and happy. And with very passing day I thank God for his beautiful sanctuary located in the spiritual land of India called Sanctum.” – David Cooper who underwent treatment in Sanctum, Delhi.

Not only was my addiction taken into account, but also other things like my anxiety and depression, and I have found better ways of dealing with it” – Anonymous client from UK who underwent treatment in Samarpan, Maharashtra.</p>
